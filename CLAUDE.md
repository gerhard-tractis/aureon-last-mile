# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Do Not Modify Settings Files

**NEVER modify, edit, or write to these files under any circumstances:**
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.claude/keybindings.json`
- Any file matching `*settings*.json`

These files control Claude's own behavior and permissions. Modifying them can break the Claude CLI tool entirely. If the user reports issues with these files, provide instructions for manual fixes rather than editing them directly.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Read Deployment Runbook Before Implementation

**BEFORE implementing any code changes, deployments, or infrastructure work, you MUST read:**

📖 **`apps/frontend/docs/deployment-runbook.md`**

This runbook contains critical lessons learned from Epic 1 that prevent common mistakes:
- GitHub Secrets configuration (correct naming, no typos)
- Vercel setup (path doubling issues, root directory settings)
- Supabase configuration (RLS testing, migration workflows)
- Railway deployment (n8n setup for Story 2.3+)
- Common deployment errors and their solutions
- Migration best practices and rollback procedures

**When to read the runbook:**
- ✅ Before starting any new story implementation
- ✅ Before creating or modifying deployment configurations
- ✅ Before running database migrations
- ✅ When encountering deployment errors
- ✅ When setting up new infrastructure (Railway, n8n, etc.)

**Why this matters:**
Epic 1 taught us that catching issues early (during development) is far better than discovering them after deployment. The runbook contains patterns and solutions that will save hours of debugging.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Deployment Rules

**NEVER deploy to Vercel, Supabase, or any production environment unless the user explicitly uses the word "deploy" or "push to production".**

When working with environment variables or configuration:
1. ALWAYS check existing configuration first (`vercel env pull`, `git diff`, etc.)
2. Show the user what's missing/different before making changes
3. Ask for explicit confirmation before modifying production settings
4. After adding env vars, inform the user they need to redeploy (don't do it yourself)

### Vercel Workflow
- `vercel env pull` → Check existing vars first
- Ask user: "Should I add X, Y, Z env vars?"
- Add only after confirmation
- Tell user: "Env vars added. You'll need to redeploy for changes to take effect."
- STOP. Let the user deploy.

**Remember:** "Use Vercel CLI to add env vars" means CHECK and ADD variables only, NOT deploy.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Git Workflow — Always Use Feature Branches

**NEVER push directly to `main`.** Branch protection is enforced for everyone including admins.

**Every code change must follow this flow:**
1. `git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>` — create a feature branch
2. Make changes, commit normally
3. `git push origin <branch-name>`
4. `gh pr create` — open a PR
5. CI runs automatically — when it passes, the PR auto-merges to main
6. Feature branch is auto-deleted after merge

**Branch naming convention:**
- `feat/` — new features (e.g. `feat/order-table-schema`)
- `fix/` — bug fixes (e.g. `fix/rls-policy-orders`)
- `chore/` — maintenance, deps, config (e.g. `chore/update-dependencies`)
- `docs/` — documentation only (e.g. `docs/update-runbook`)

**Why this matters:**
- Direct pushes to `main` are rejected by GitHub
- CI (tests/lint/build) must pass before merge
- Merge triggers the full deploy pipeline: Supabase → Vercel + VPS Worker
