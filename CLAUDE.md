# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Do Not Modify Settings Files

**NEVER modify, edit, or write to these files under any circumstances:**
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.claude/keybindings.json`
- Any file matching `*settings*.json`

These files control Claude's own behavior and permissions. Modifying them can break the Claude CLI tool entirely. If the user reports issues with these files, provide instructions for manual fixes rather than editing them directly.
