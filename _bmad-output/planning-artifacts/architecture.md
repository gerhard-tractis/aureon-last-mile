## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements Summary:**

Aureon Last Mile encompasses **82 functional requirements** organized into 13 categories:

1. **BI Dashboard & Data Ingestion (FR1-FR11)**: Business intelligence foundation providing customer volume analysis, geographic heatmaps, capacity utilization tracking, SLA performance metrics, and report exports in CSV/PDF formats. Multiple data ingestion methods (retailer APIs, email manifest parsing, manual CSV uploads) with historical data storage for trend analysis.

2. **Pickup Verification Mobile (FR12-FR19)**: Mobile-first barcode scanning workflow for pickup crews at retailer distribution centers. Includes real-time verification status, offline-first capability with local scanning and background sync, discrepancy detection before signing, digital signature capture, and PDF receipt generation with complete audit trails.

3. **Hub Reception & Reconciliation (FR20-FR23)**: Systematic package logging at operator hub with automatic reconciliation against signed pickup manifests, distinguishing between retailer shortages (never received) and internal handling issues, with full accountability tracking (timestamp, user, operator context).

4. **Warehouse/Inventory WMS (FR24-FR28)**: Location-based inventory tracking with barcode scanning for package movements, real-time search by order number, location history for theft investigation support, and reconciliation reports comparing signed manifests versus received inventory.

5. **Loading & Sectorization (FR29-FR37)**: Configurable loading workflows (immediate scan-and-load vs batch scanning based on hub layout), sectorization rules enforcement with comuna/district-to-zone mappings, real-time loading progress tracking, and automatic route creation in operator's preferred routing tool (SimpliRoute, Beetrack, Driv.in) via API.

6. **Capacity Planning (FR38-FR41)**: Real-time order visibility from retailer e-commerce systems, automated alerts when retailers exceed capacity limits, forecast accuracy tracking (predicted vs actual), enabling 1-2 day advance resource planning.

7. **Integration Hub (FR42-FR49)**: Multi-retailer API integrations (Falabella, Shopee, Mercado Libre, Ripley, Paris), last-mile routing tool integrations with bidirectional status sync, webhook-based delivery status transformation and distribution to each retailer's required JSON format, with graceful degradation to email parsing when APIs unavailable.

8. **User Management & Auth (FR50-FR58)**: Role-based access control (pickup crew, warehouse staff, loading crew, operations managers, admins) with JWT-based authentication, secure session management, and strict tenant isolation ensuring operators cannot access other operators' data.

9. **AI Support Agent (FR59-FR64)**: Natural language chat interface for troubleshooting, querying audit logs and system diagnostics, providing recommendations for common issues, escalating complex cases to human support, and suggesting security camera footage timestamps based on package location audit trails.

10. **Platform Administration (FR65-FR70)**: Tenant provisioning with environment configurations, retailer API integration setup, real-time platform health monitoring (uptime, performance, error rates), customer usage analytics, SLA threshold alerting, and infrastructure scaling management.

11. **Multi-Tenancy (FR71-FR75)**: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for data isolation, operator-specific settings configuration (sectorization rules, hub layout, branding), subscription tier tracking (Starter, Growth, Enterprise) with usage limits enforcement, overage charge calculation, and billing history visibility.

12. **Configuration Management (FR76-FR78)**: Sectorization rule definition, automated zone assignment validation, and suggested assignments based on address and rules.

13. **Audit & Compliance (FR79-FR82)**: Comprehensive data access logging (user_id, operator_id, timestamp, action, IP address), 7-year audit log retention per Chilean commercial law, and encryption of sensitive data at rest with operator-specific keys.

**Architectural Implications:**
- **Multi-tenant SaaS** requires PostgreSQL RLS policies at database level
- **Offline-first mobile** demands IndexedDB local storage, background sync queues, conflict resolution
- **Real-time updates** need WebSocket connections for live dashboard data
- **Integration orchestration** requires retry queues, webhook handling, data transformation pipelines
- **Role-based workflows** demand distinct UI/UX per user type with permission enforcement at API and database layers

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Selection Decision

**Chosen Foundation:** [Razikus Supabase-Next.js Template](https://github.com/Razikus/supabase-nextjs-template) + PWA Enhancement Layer

### Template Research Summary

**Research Conducted:** Three key areas evaluated for compatibility with project requirements:

1. **Supabase + Next.js 14 Integration Options:**
   - Official Vercel Supabase Template (minimal, cookie-based auth)
   - Nextbase (comprehensive with testing suite)
   - Hikari (includes Stripe integration)
   - Supa-Next-Starter (shadcn/ui components)

2. **PWA Offline-First Technologies:**
   - Serwist (modern service worker solution, successor to next-pwa)
   - @ducanh2912/next-pwa (popular PWA package)
   - IndexedDB + Dexie (offline data storage and sync queues)
   - Background Sync API (automatic upload when connection restored)

3. **Multi-Tenant SaaS Templates:**
   - SupaSaaS (production-ready, paid, 40+ components)
   - Razikus Template (open-source, Next.js 15, comprehensive RLS policies)
   - Makerkit (production-ready, paid)
   - Nextbase (SaaS starter with Stripe)
   - Vercel B2B Multi-Tenant Kit (Stripe + Supabase)

### Requirements Coverage Analysis

| Requirement | Coverage |
|------------|----------|
| Next.js 14 App Router | ✅ All modern templates support this |
| Supabase Integration | ✅ Multiple excellent options with RLS, Auth, Realtime |
| Offline-first PWA | ⚠️ No templates include this - requires manual integration |
| Multi-tenant Patterns | ✅ SupaSaaS, Razikus have production RLS policies |
| TypeScript | ✅ Standard in all modern templates |
| Vercel Deployment | ✅ All templates support Vercel deployment |

**Key Finding:** No single template combines all three critical features (Supabase integration, multi-tenant RLS patterns, offline-first PWA capabilities). The PWA gap is expected since most SaaS starters focus on desktop dashboards rather than offline mobile workflows.

### Rationale for Razikus Template Selection

**Why Razikus Template + PWA Enhancement (vs. Alternatives)?**

**✅ Advantages:**
- **Free and open-source** - No licensing costs, full code control
- **Production-ready multi-tenant foundation** - Secure RLS policies already implemented
- **Comprehensive Supabase integration** - Auth, file storage, task management demos included
- **Next.js 15 ready** - Backwards compatible with Next.js 14, future-proof
- **Active maintenance** - Recent updates, responsive to Next.js ecosystem changes
- **Clean architecture** - Well-documented codebase with i18n support (EN/PL/ZH)
- **PWA addition is manageable** - Serwist integration well-documented, estimated 2-3 days
- **Aligns with 4-week MVP timeline** - Starter handles foundation, focus energy on business features

**❌ Rejected Alternatives:**

1. **Option B (Vercel Official Template + Build Everything):**
   - Rejected because: Requires implementing multi-tenant RLS policies from scratch (~1 week overhead)
   - Would extend MVP timeline beyond 4 weeks
   - Unnecessary greenfield work when production patterns exist

2. **Option C (Minimal Setup - Build from Scratch):**
   - Rejected because: 2+ weeks setup time incompatible with 4-week MVP
   - Risk of missing production security patterns (RLS policies, auth flows)
   - Reinventing solved problems (multi-tenancy, file storage)

3. **SupaSaaS (Paid Template):**
   - Rejected because: $199+ licensing cost unnecessary when Razikus offers equivalent features open-source
   - Similar implementation effort to add PWA layer
   - No significant time savings to justify cost

### PWA Enhancement Strategy

**Approach:** Augment Razikus template with offline-first capabilities using modern PWA technologies.

**Technology Stack for PWA Layer:**
- **Service Worker Management:** Serwist (successor to next-pwa, better Next.js 14+ support)
- **Offline Data Storage:** IndexedDB via Dexie (type-safe, promise-based API)
- **Background Synchronization:** Background Sync API (automatic upload when connectivity restored)
- **Offline Detection:** Navigator.onLine + custom connectivity monitoring

**Implementation Components:**
1. **Service Worker Configuration:**
   - Install Serwist and configure for Next.js App Router
   - Define caching strategies (network-first for API, cache-first for assets)
   - Enable offline page fallback

2. **Offline Scan Queue:**
   - IndexedDB schema: `scan_queue` table with fields (id, order_id, barcode, timestamp, synced)
   - Optimistic UI updates (scan → save locally → show success → sync background)
   - Conflict resolution strategy for duplicate scans

3. **Background Sync:**
   - Register sync event on connectivity change
   - Batch upload queued scans to Railway API
   - Update local IndexedDB status on successful sync
   - Retry logic for failed uploads (exponential backoff)

4. **Offline UI Indicators:**
   - Connection status banner (green: online, yellow: offline, gray: syncing)
   - Queued scan count badge
   - Visual feedback on sync completion

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 2-3 days
- Day 1: Serwist setup, basic service worker, offline page
- Day 2: IndexedDB schema, scan queue logic, optimistic updates
- Day 3: Background sync, conflict resolution, testing offline scenarios

### Implementation Timeline with Starter Template

**Week 0 (Pre-Development - 2 days):**
- Clone Razikus template
- Configure Supabase project (database, auth, RLS policies)
- Deploy skeleton to Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
- Add Serwist PWA layer (2-3 days overlap with Week 1)

**Weeks 1-2 (BI Dashboard):**
- Build business intelligence screens using template's component patterns
- Implement Chart.js visualizations from mockups
- Configure Supabase Realtime for live metric updates
- Test multi-tenant data isolation with sample operators

**Weeks 3-4 (Pickup Verification Mobile PWA):**
- Build mobile PWA using template's auth + RLS foundation
- Leverage IndexedDB offline queue (already implemented in Week 0)
- Implement barcode scanning, digital signature, PDF generation
- Test offline scenarios (warehouse connectivity loss, background sync)

**Total Timeline:** 4 weeks MVP delivery maintained

1. **API Design Pattern**: REST API (required for external integrations, mobile sync, BI dashboard)
2. **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query (required for offline queue, dashboard caching)
3. **Data Modeling**: Multi-tenant isolation patterns (security requirement, prevents data leaks)
4. **Error Handling**: Standardized format (ensures consistent user experience, debugging)
5. **Integration Orchestration**: n8n for email/webhook processing (handles retailer integrations)

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture Significantly):**
6. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer approach (impacts performance, costs, user experience)
7. **Database Migrations**: Supabase Migrations (schema evolution, deployment safety)
8. **Monitoring & Logging**: Sentry + Railway/Vercel dashboards (production observability)
9. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions (code quality, deployment automation)
10. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger (developer experience, AI agent integration)

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**
- Advanced analytics dashboards (beyond basic BI metrics)
- Multi-language support beyond Spanish (i18n already in Razikus template)
- Mobile native apps (iOS/Android) - PWA sufficient for MVP
- Advanced AI features (route optimization, predictive analytics)

### Data Architecture

#### **Database: Supabase PostgreSQL**
- **Version**: Latest stable (provided by Supabase managed service)
- **Rationale**:
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) solves multi-tenant isolation at database level
  - Built-in auth, real-time, storage reduce custom implementation
  - Familiar PostgreSQL for complex queries, JSON support for flexible data
- **Affects**: All data persistence, queries, real-time updates

#### **Data Modeling Patterns**

**1. Multi-Tenant Isolation**
```sql
-- Every table includes operator_id
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  operator_id UUID NOT NULL,  -- Tenant identifier
  order_number VARCHAR(50),
  ...
);

-- RLS policy enforces isolation
CREATE POLICY "tenant_isolation" ON orders
  FOR ALL USING (operator_id = auth.operator_id());
```
- **Rationale**: Security requirement (NFR-S2), prevents accidental or malicious cross-tenant access
- **Affects**: All database tables, API queries, frontend filters

**2. Audit Log Pattern**
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  operator_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,       -- 'SCAN_ORDER', 'SIGN_MANIFEST'
  resource_type VARCHAR(50),         -- 'order', 'manifest'
  resource_id UUID,
  changes_json JSONB,                -- Before/after state
  ip_address VARCHAR(50),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
- **Rationale**: Chilean commercial law (7-year retention), shortage dispute resolution
- **Affects**: All write operations, compliance reporting, security investigations

**3. Raw + Normalized Data Storage**
```sql
CREATE TABLE retailer_orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  operator_id UUID NOT NULL,
  -- Normalized (internal format)
  order_number VARCHAR(50),
  customer_name VARCHAR(255),
  delivery_address TEXT,
  -- Raw (original retailer format)
  retailer_name VARCHAR(50),
  raw_data JSONB,                    -- Original JSON/CSV data
  imported_via VARCHAR(50),          -- 'API', 'EMAIL', 'MANUAL'
  imported_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
- **Rationale**: Enables re-processing if parsing errors occur, debugging integration issues, retailer format changes
- **Affects**: Integration layer, data imports, troubleshooting workflows

**4. Soft Deletes**
```sql
-- Add to all main tables
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL;

-- Queries filter deleted records
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Recovery is simple
UPDATE orders SET deleted_at = NULL WHERE id = 'order-123';
```
- **Rationale**: Accidental deletion recovery, data retention compliance, audit trail
- **Affects**: All delete operations, queries, admin interfaces

#### **Migration Management: Supabase Migrations**
- **Tool**: Supabase CLI with Git-tracked SQL migration files
- **Workflow**:
  ```bash
  supabase migration new add_feature     # Create migration
  # Edit .sql file with schema changes
  supabase db reset                      # Test locally
  supabase db push                       # Deploy to production
  ```
- **Rationale**: Version-controlled schema changes, rollback support, works seamlessly with Supabase RLS
- **Affects**: Database schema evolution, deployment process, team collaboration

---

### Authentication & Security

#### **Authentication: Supabase Auth (JWT + RBAC)**
- **Provided by**: Razikus starter template + Supabase built-in
- **Features**:
  - JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration (NFR-S3)
  - Role-based access control (pickup_crew, warehouse_staff, loading_crew, operations_manager, admin)
  - Session management with httpOnly cookies (XSS protection)
  - Automatic token refresh
- **Rationale**: Production-ready auth system, saves weeks of custom implementation, meets security requirements
- **Affects**: All API endpoints, frontend routing guards, database RLS policies

#### **Security Middleware**
- **API Layer**: JWT validation on every request, rate limiting (1000 req/min per operator)
- **Database Layer**: RLS policies enforce tenant isolation + role permissions
- **Frontend Layer**: Route guards prevent unauthorized access to admin pages
- **Rationale**: Defense in depth (multiple layers), prevents common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- **Affects**: API middleware, database policies, frontend routing

#### **Data Encryption**
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all HTTP traffic (automatic via Vercel/Railway/Supabase)
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for database (Supabase managed)
- **Sensitive Fields**: Additional operator-specific keys for PII (future enhancement)
- **Rationale**: Security requirement (NFR-S1), protects customer data, regulatory compliance
- **Affects**: Infrastructure configuration, sensitive data handling

---

### API & Communication Patterns

#### **API Design: REST API**
- **Pattern**: RESTful endpoints with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Rationale**:
  - External integrations require REST (retailer webhooks)
  - Simple to implement, test, and debug
  - Excellent caching support (HTTP headers)
  - Universal compatibility (mobile, web, n8n)
- **Affects**: Railway backend endpoints, mobile app sync, n8n workflows
- **Example Endpoints**:
  ```
  GET    /api/orders                    # List orders
  POST   /api/orders                    # Create order
  GET    /api/orders/:id                # Get order details
  PUT    /api/orders/:id                # Update order
  DELETE /api/orders/:id                # Soft delete order
  POST   /api/manifests/import          # Import manifest (CSV/API)
  POST   /api/scans                     # Record barcode scan
  GET    /api/dashboard/metrics         # BI dashboard data
  ```

#### **API Documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger**
- **Tool**: Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Interactive Docs**: Auto-generated at `/api/docs`
- **Rationale**:
  - Industry standard for REST APIs
  - Interactive testing (developers can try endpoints in browser)
  - AI agents can read spec (Claude can understand OpenAPI)
  - Auto-generate TypeScript types for frontend
- **Affects**: API development, frontend integration, AI agent implementation
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * @swagger
   * /api/scans:
   *   post:
   *     summary: Record barcode scan
   *     requestBody:
   *       required: true
   *       content:
   *         application/json:
   *           schema:
   *             type: object
   *             properties:
   *               barcode: { type: string }
   *               manifest_id: { type: string }
   *     responses:
   *       200:
   *         description: Scan recorded successfully
   *       409:
   *         description: Duplicate scan detected
   */
  ```

#### **Error Handling Standards**
- **Format**: Standardized JSON response for all errors
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "BARCODE_NOT_FOUND",
      "message": "Código de barras no encontrado",
      "details": "Barcode '7804123456789' not in manifest",
      "field": "barcode",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-06T14:30:22Z",
      "request_id": "req_abc123"
    }
  }
  ```
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Standard codes (400 validation, 401 auth, 403 forbidden, 404 not found, 409 conflict, 429 rate limit, 500 server error, 503 unavailable)
- **Frontend Display**: Toast notifications, inline validation, modal dialogs, error boundaries
- **Rationale**: Consistent user experience, easy debugging via request_id, AI agents can parse errors uniformly
- **Affects**: All API endpoints, frontend error handling, logging

#### **Rate Limiting**
- **Strategy**: Token bucket algorithm
- **Limits**:
  - Per operator: 1000 requests/minute
  - Per user: 100 requests/minute
  - Burst allowance: 20 requests
- **Rationale**: Prevent abuse, protect infrastructure, ensure fair resource allocation
- **Affects**: API middleware, error responses (429 status)

#### **Integration Orchestration: n8n**
- **Platform**: n8n (self-hosted on Railway)
- **Purpose**: Handle retailer integrations, email parsing, webhook transformations
- **Workflows**:
  1. **Email Manifest Import**: IMAP → Parse CSV → POST to Railway API
  2. **Retailer API Polling**: Scheduled fetch → Transform data → POST to Railway API
  3. **Webhook Receiver**: Retailer status updates → Transform → Update database
  4. **Fallback Chain**: API → Email → Manual upload
- **Rationale**:
  - Visual workflow builder (non-developers can modify)
  - Separates integration logic from core app
  - Built-in retry, error handling, logging
  - Handles CSV emails with cron jobs (real-world retailer reality)
- **Affects**: Retailer integrations, data import workflows, webhook handling
- **Example n8n Workflow**:
  ```
  [IMAP Email Trigger] → Every 5 minutes check inbox
    ↓
  [Filter: Subject contains "Manifiesto"] → Only process manifest emails
    ↓
  [Download Attachment] → Get CSV file
    ↓
  [CSV Parser] → Parse rows to JSON
    ↓
  [Data Transformation] → Retailer schema → Aureon schema
    ↓
  [HTTP POST] → POST to Railway API /api/manifests/import
    ↓
  [Mark Email as Processed] → Move to "Processed" folder
  ```

### Frontend Architecture

#### **State Management**

**Local State: Zustand**
- **Version**: Latest stable (v4.x)
- **Purpose**: Client-side UI state, offline queue, sync status
- **Rationale**:
  - Lightweight (3KB), simple API (similar to useState)
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Built-in persistence middleware (localStorage/IndexedDB)
  - Perfect for offline scan queue
- **Affects**: Offline PWA, scan queue, UI filters, sync indicators
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // Offline scan queue store
  const useScanStore = create(
    persist(
      (set) => ({
        scans: [],
        addScan: (barcode) => set((state) => ({
          scans: [...state.scans, { barcode, synced: false, timestamp: Date.now() }]
        })),
        markSynced: (barcode) => set((state) => ({
          scans: state.scans.map(s => s.barcode === barcode ? { ...s, synced: true } : s)
        }))
      }),
      { name: 'scan-queue-storage' }
    )
  )
  ```

**Server State: TanStack Query**
- **Version**: v5.x (React Query)
- **Purpose**: API data fetching, caching, background refetching
- **Rationale**:
  - Automatic caching reduces API calls
  - Built-in loading/error states
  - Background refetch keeps data fresh
  - Optimistic updates for better UX
- **Affects**: BI Dashboard, order lists, customer data, all API interactions
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // Dashboard metrics with auto-refresh
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['dashboard-metrics', operatorId],
    queryFn: () => fetchDashboardMetrics(operatorId),
    staleTime: 30000,        // Consider fresh for 30s
    refetchInterval: 60000   // Background refresh every 60s
  })
  ```

#### **Component Architecture**
- **Pattern**: Razikus template patterns (already established)
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components (from template)
- **Structure**: Feature-based organization (dashboard/, pickup/, manifests/)
- **Rationale**: Leverage template's proven patterns, maintain consistency
- **Affects**: Code organization, component reusability, styling

#### **Routing Strategy**
- **Platform**: Next.js 14 App Router
- **Guards**: Middleware checks auth + role before rendering
- **Rationale**: Built-in to Next.js, server-side rendering support, automatic code splitting
- **Affects**: Page routing, role-based access control, SEO

#### **Performance Optimization**
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic via Next.js
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component (automatic)
- **Bundle Analysis**: Use @next/bundle-analyzer in development
- **Lazy Loading**: Dashboard widgets load progressively
- **Rationale**: Meet NFR-P1 (≤2s page loads), reduce initial bundle size
- **Affects**: Build configuration, component loading patterns

---

### Infrastructure & Deployment

#### **Hosting Strategy**

**Frontend: Vercel (Next.js 14 App Router)**
- **Rationale**: Optimized for Next.js, global CDN, controlled deployments, Edge Functions
- **Features**: Manual deployment for cost control, CI via GitHub Actions, Edge Functions
- **Note**: Auto-deploy disabled to prevent excessive deployment costs (~90% cost savings)
- **Cost**: Free tier for MVP
- **Affects**: Frontend deployment, CDN delivery, preview environments

**Automation Worker: Hostinger VPS (São Paulo, KVM 2)**
- **Rationale**:
  - No timeout limits (handles long-running browser automation + manifest imports)
  - Persistent Playwright/Chromium installation (not possible in ephemeral containers)
  - Full systemd control (n8n daemon, worker daemon, auto-restart)
  - No Redis needed — Supabase `jobs` table with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` replaces BullMQ
  - $6.99/month vs Railway's $5-20/month — comparable cost, more capability
- **Services**: n8n 2.9.0 (workflow orchestration, IMAP listener, CSV processing), Playwright + Chromium (browser automation, on-demand), Worker process (job queue orchestrator)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions → SSH → deploy.sh (on push to `apps/worker/**`)
- **Cost**: $6.99/month fixed
- **Affects**: Automation jobs, n8n workflows, browser scraping (Story 2.6)
- **Note**: BullMQ (Redis job queue) replaced by Supabase `jobs` table with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`

**Database + Services: Supabase**
- **Components**: PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions
- **Rationale**: All-in-one platform, managed services, excellent DX
- **Cost**: Free tier MVP, ~$25/month Pro at 5-10 customers
- **Affects**: Data persistence, authentication, real-time updates, file storage

#### **Caching Strategy**

**Layer 1: Frontend (TanStack Query)**
- Dashboard metrics: **30 seconds** stale time, **60 seconds** background refresh
- Customer lists: **5 minutes** stale time
- Order details: **1 minute** stale time
- **Rationale**: Balance freshness vs performance, reduce unnecessary API calls

**Layer 2: Supabase (Query-level)**
- Real-time order status: **No cache** (use Supabase Realtime)
- Read replicas handle read-heavy dashboard queries
- **Rationale**: Redis removed — Supabase query performance is sufficient for MVP scale. Re-evaluate at 5+ customers.
- **Note**: BullMQ (Redis job queue) replaced by Supabase `jobs` table with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`

**Layer 3: CDN (Vercel - Automatic)**
- Static assets: **Forever** (hash-based filenames invalidate automatically)
- HTML pages: **No cache** (dynamic content)
- **Rationale**: Maximize performance for static resources, ensure dynamic content is fresh

**Layer 4: Offline (Service Worker + IndexedDB)**
- App shell: **Cache forever**, update on new deployment
- Scan queue: **Until synced** to server
- Current manifest: **Until pickup complete**
- **Rationale**: Enable offline operation, critical for warehouse connectivity issues

**Cache Invalidation**:
- User updates data → Invalidate related cache keys immediately
- Background jobs complete → Invalidate affected metrics
- Manual invalidation: Admin dashboard "Clear cache" button

#### **CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions**
- **Workflow**:
  ```yaml
  on: [push, pull_request]
  jobs:
    test:
      - npm run test           # Jest unit tests
      - npm run type-check     # TypeScript compilation
      - npm run lint           # ESLint code quality
      - npm run build          # Verify build succeeds

    deploy-preview:           # On PR: Deploy preview
      - Vercel preview URL
      - Railway preview environment

    deploy-production:        # On merge to main: Deploy prod
      - Vercel production
      - Railway production
  ```
- **Rationale**: Catch bugs before production, automated testing, preview environments for review
- **Affects**: Code quality, deployment process, team collaboration

#### **Monitoring & Logging**

**Error Tracking: Sentry**
- **Free Tier**: 5,000 errors/month
- **Features**: Stack traces, error grouping, release tracking, user context
- **Rationale**: Production error visibility, understand what breaks and when
- **Affects**: Error reporting, debugging production issues

**Performance Monitoring**:
- **Vercel Analytics**: Page load times, Core Web Vitals
- **Railway Dashboard**: CPU, memory, API response times
- **Supabase Dashboard**: Query performance, connection count
- **Rationale**: Meet NFR-P1 (≤2s loads), identify bottlenecks
- **Affects**: Performance optimization priorities

**Uptime Monitoring**:
- **Tool**: BetterStack or UptimeRobot (free tier)
- **Check Interval**: Every 5 minutes
- **Alerts**: Email/SMS on downtime
- **Rationale**: Know when app is down before customers complain
- **Affects**: Incident response, uptime SLA tracking

**Structured Logging**:
- **Format**: JSON logs with request_id, operator_id, user_id, timestamp
- **Destination**: Railway logs (searchable, filterable)
- **Retention**: 30 days on Railway
- **Rationale**: Debug production issues via request_id, trace user actions
- **Affects**: Debugging workflow, customer support

**Alert Rules**:
```
🚨 Critical (immediate notification):
  - App downtime > 5 minutes
  - Error rate > 5% of requests
  - Database connections > 90%

⚠️ Warning (check within hour):
  - API p95 response time > 1 second
  - Failed background jobs > 10 in 1 hour
  - Disk usage > 80%

ℹ️ Info (weekly review):
  - New operator signups
  - Integration failures (retailer API unavailable)
  - Usage approaching tier limits
```

#### **Environment Configuration**
- **Environments**: Development (local), Preview (per PR), Production
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables in Vercel/Railway dashboards
- **Environment Variables**:
  ```bash
  # Supabase
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ...          # Backend only

  # Railway API
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.aureon.com

  # n8n
  N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.aureon.com/webhook

  # External Integrations
  FALABELLA_API_KEY=xxx
  SHOPEE_API_SECRET=xxx

  # Monitoring
  SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@sentry.io/xxx
  ```
- **Rationale**: Separate credentials per environment, never commit secrets to Git
- **Affects**: Deployment configuration, security

---

### PDF Generation Strategy

#### **Approach: Client-Side (jsPDF)**
- **Library**: jsPDF (open-source, maintained)
- **Rationale**:
  - ✅ Works offline (critical for mobile PWA)
  - ✅ No server load (Railway doesn't process PDFs)
  - ✅ Faster (no API roundtrip)
  - ✅ User can generate PDF even without internet
  - ⚠️ Slightly larger JavaScript bundle (~100KB)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Pickup verification receipt (after signing manifest)
  - Delivery confirmation (after drop-off)
  - Discrepancy reports (missing/damaged items)
- **Affects**: Mobile PWA bundle size, offline capabilities
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  import jsPDF from 'jspdf'

  const generatePickupReceipt = (manifest, scans) => {
    const doc = new jsPDF()
    doc.text('Comprobante de Retiro', 10, 10)
    doc.text(`Cliente: ${manifest.retailer_name}`, 10, 20)
    doc.text(`Órdenes escaneadas: ${scans.length}/${manifest.total_orders}`, 10, 30)
    // Add signature image
    doc.addImage(signatureDataURL, 'PNG', 10, 40, 50, 20)
    doc.save(`retiro-${manifest.id}.pdf`)
  }
  ```

---

### Architectural Trade-Offs Accepted

**1. REST over GraphQL**
- **Trade-off**: Potential over-fetching, multiple requests for related data
- **Accepted because**: External webhooks require REST anyway, simpler to implement, 4-week timeline
- **Mitigation**: Use TanStack Query to batch and cache requests

**2. Client-Side PDF over Server-Side**
- **Trade-off**: Larger JavaScript bundle, limited PDF complexity
- **Accepted because**: Offline capability is critical, mobile workers often have poor connectivity
- **Mitigation**: Use code splitting to load jsPDF only when needed

**3. Supabase Managed Service over Self-Hosted PostgreSQL**
- **Trade-off**: Vendor lock-in, less control over database configuration
- **Accepted because**: Managed RLS, auth, realtime save weeks of development, can migrate later if needed
- **Mitigation**: Use standard PostgreSQL features, avoid Supabase-specific extensions

**4. n8n for Integrations over Custom Code**
- **Trade-off**: Additional service to maintain, learning curve for n8n
- **Accepted because**: Visual workflows enable non-developers to modify, faster iteration on retailer integrations
- **Mitigation**: Keep critical business logic in main app, use n8n only for data transformation

**5. Multi-Layer Caching over Simple Caching**
- **Trade-off**: Cache invalidation complexity, multiple systems to monitor
- **Accepted because**: Performance requirements are strict (≤2s loads), reduces database load significantly
- **Mitigation**: Clear cache invalidation rules, monitoring for stale data issues

---

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

_This section defines mandatory patterns that ensure multiple AI agents (and future development sessions) write compatible, consistent code that works together seamlessly._

### Pattern Categories Defined

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:** 5 categories where AI agents could make different implementation choices that would cause integration conflicts:

1. **Naming Conflicts**: Database, API, code naming conventions
2. **Structure Conflicts**: File organization, project structure
3. **Format Conflicts**: API responses, data exchange formats
4. **Communication Conflicts**: Events, state management patterns
5. **Process Conflicts**: Error handling, loading states

These patterns are **mandatory** for all AI agents implementing features in this codebase.

---

### Naming Patterns

#### **Database Naming Conventions (PostgreSQL/Supabase)**

**Tables: `snake_case`, plural**
```sql
-- ✅ Correct
CREATE TABLE orders (...)
CREATE TABLE barcode_scans (...)
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (...)
CREATE TABLE retailer_orders (...)

-- ❌ Incorrect
CREATE TABLE Orders (...)          -- Don't use PascalCase
CREATE TABLE order (...)           -- Don't use singular
CREATE TABLE barcodeScan (...)     -- Don't use camelCase
```

**Columns: `snake_case`**
```sql
-- ✅ Correct
user_id, created_at, operator_id, order_number, delivery_address

-- ❌ Incorrect
userId, createdAt, OrderNumber    -- Don't use camelCase or PascalCase
```

**Foreign Keys: `referenced_table_singular_id`**
```sql
-- ✅ Correct
user_id REFERENCES users(id)
operator_id REFERENCES operators(id)
manifest_id REFERENCES manifests(id)

-- ❌ Incorrect
fk_user, user_fk, UserId         -- Don't use prefixes or different casing
```

**Indexes: `idx_table_column[_column]`**
```sql
-- ✅ Correct
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_operator_id ON orders(operator_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_scans_manifest_barcode ON scans(manifest_id, barcode);

-- ❌ Incorrect
CREATE INDEX orders_operator_index ...    -- Missing idx_ prefix
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_operator ...      -- Missing _id suffix for clarity
```

**Rationale:** PostgreSQL conventions, prevents case-sensitivity issues, readable, consistent with industry standards.

---

#### **API Naming Conventions (REST)**

**Endpoints: `/api/resource` (plural), lowercase**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
GET    /api/orders              // List all orders
POST   /api/orders              // Create new order
GET    /api/orders/:id          // Get specific order
PUT    /api/orders/:id          // Update order
DELETE /api/orders/:id          // Delete order
GET    /api/manifests           // List manifests
POST   /api/manifests/:id/sign  // Action on manifest

// ❌ Incorrect
GET    /api/order               // Don't use singular
GET    /api/Orders              // Don't use PascalCase
GET    /api/get-orders          // Don't use verbs in endpoint names (except actions)
POST   /api/orders/create       // Redundant - POST implies create
```

**Nested Resources:**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
GET    /api/manifests/:id/scans           // Get scans for manifest
POST   /api/manifests/:id/scans           // Create scan for manifest
GET    /api/operators/:id/orders          // Get orders for operator

// ❌ Incorrect
GET    /api/scans?manifest_id=:id         // Use nesting for clear relationships
```

**Action Endpoints (Non-CRUD):**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct (use verbs for actions)
POST   /api/manifests/:id/sign            // Sign manifest
POST   /api/orders/:id/verify             // Verify order
POST   /api/manifests/:id/import          // Import manifest

// ❌ Incorrect
POST   /api/manifests/:id/signature       // Use verb, not noun
```

**Route Parameters: `:paramName` (camelCase)**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
/api/orders/:orderId
/api/manifests/:manifestId/scans/:scanId

// ❌ Incorrect
/api/orders/{id}                          // Don't use curly braces (Express uses colons)
/api/orders/:order_id                     // Don't use snake_case in routes
```

**Query Parameters: `snake_case`** (matches API response JSON)
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
GET /api/orders?operator_id=123&created_after=2026-02-01

// ❌ Incorrect
GET /api/orders?operatorId=123            // Don't use camelCase
```

**Rationale:** RESTful conventions, plural resources, consistent with industry standards, clear action endpoints.

---

#### **Code Naming Conventions (TypeScript/React)**

**Files:**
```
✅ Correct:
  Components:     UserCard.tsx, DashboardMetrics.tsx, PickupVerification.tsx (PascalCase)
  Utilities:      formatDate.ts, apiClient.ts, scanQueue.ts (camelCase)
  Stores:         scanStore.ts, authStore.ts (camelCase + Store suffix)
  Types:          api.ts, database.ts, models.ts (camelCase)
  API Routes:     route.ts (Next.js convention)

❌ Incorrect:
  user-card.tsx, user_card.tsx      // Don't use kebab-case or snake_case for components
  FormatDate.ts                      // Don't use PascalCase for utilities
```

**React Components: `PascalCase`**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
function UserCard() {}
const DashboardMetrics = () => {}
export default PickupVerification

// ❌ Incorrect
function userCard() {}                     // Don't use camelCase
const dashboard_metrics = () => {}         // Don't use snake_case
```

**Functions: `camelCase`**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
function getUserData() {}
async function fetchOrders() {}
const handleSubmit = () => {}

// ❌ Incorrect
function GetUserData() {}                  // Don't use PascalCase
function get_user_data() {}                // Don't use snake_case
```

**Variables: `camelCase`**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const userId = "123"
const orderCount = 42
const isLoading = true
let currentManifest = null

// ❌ Incorrect
const user_id = "123"                      // Don't use snake_case
const OrderCount = 42                      // Don't use PascalCase
```

**Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const API_BASE_URL = "https://api.aureon.com"
const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
const DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE = 50

// ❌ Incorrect
const apiBaseUrl = "..."                   // Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for true constants
const MaxRetryAttempts = 3                 // Don't use PascalCase
```

**Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase`**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
}

type OrderStatus = 'pending' | 'verified' | 'completed'

interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T
}

// ❌ Incorrect
interface user {}                          // Don't use camelCase
type order_status = 'pending'              // Don't use snake_case
```

**Enums: `PascalCase` for name, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for values**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
enum OrderStatus {
  PENDING = 'PENDING',
  VERIFIED = 'VERIFIED',
  COMPLETED = 'COMPLETED'
}

// ❌ Incorrect
enum orderStatus {}                        // Don't use camelCase for enum name
enum OrderStatus { pending = 'pending' }   // Don't use camelCase for values
```

**Rationale:** TypeScript/React conventions, matches Next.js ecosystem, clear distinction between components and utilities.

**Key Organizational Principles:**

1. **Feature-based components**: Group by feature (`dashboard/`, `pickup/`) NOT by type (`cards/`, `buttons/`)
2. **Shared components**: Only truly reusable components go in `components/shared/`
3. **API routes**: Match REST resource structure (`/api/orders/:id/scans`)
4. **Utilities centralized**: All helpers in `lib/`, organized by purpose
5. **Types centralized**: All types in `types/`, re-exported from `index.ts`
6. **Tests mirror structure**: `__tests__/components/dashboard/` mirrors `src/components/dashboard/`

**Rationale:** Next.js App Router conventions, feature-based for easier navigation, clear separation of concerns, scalable structure.

---

#### **File Structure Patterns**

**Component File Structure:**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct: components/dashboard/MetricsCard.tsx

// 1. Imports (grouped: external → internal → types)
import React from 'react'
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/Card'
import { formatNumber } from '@/lib/utils/formatDate'
import type { Metric } from '@/types/models'

// 2. Types/Interfaces (if component-specific)
interface MetricsCardProps {
  metric: Metric
  isLoading?: boolean
}

// 3. Component
export function MetricsCard({ metric, isLoading }: MetricsCardProps) {
  // Component logic
  return (
    <Card>
      {/* JSX */}
    </Card>
  )
}

// 4. Sub-components (if any, keep co-located)
function MetricValue({ value }: { value: number }) {
  return <span>{formatNumber(value)}</span>
}

// ❌ Incorrect: Don't split into multiple files unless component is large (>200 lines)
```

**API Route File Structure:**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct: app/api/orders/route.ts

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { createClient } from '@/lib/db/supabase'
import { validateAuth } from '@/lib/api/auth'
import type { Order } from '@/types/models'

// GET /api/orders
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const { user, operator_id } = await validateAuth(request)
  const supabase = createClient()

  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('orders')
    .select('*')
    .eq('operator_id', operator_id)

  if (error) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: { code: 'DB_ERROR', message: error.message } },
      { status: 500 }
    )
  }

  return NextResponse.json(data)
}

// POST /api/orders
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // Similar structure
}
```

---

### Format Patterns

#### **API Response Formats**

**Success Responses (200-299): Direct data, no wrapper**
```json
// ✅ Correct: Single resource
{
  "id": "order-123",
  "order_number": "FAL-20260206-001",
  "customer_name": "María González",
  "delivery_address": "Av. Providencia 123, Santiago",
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2026-02-06T14:30:00Z"
}

// ✅ Correct: Collection (array)
[
  { "id": "order-1", "order_number": "FAL-001", ... },
  { "id": "order-2", "order_number": "FAL-002", ... }
]

// ❌ Incorrect: Don't use wrapper
{
  "data": { "id": "order-123", ... }      // Unnecessary wrapper
}

{
  "success": true,
  "payload": { ... }                      // Overly complex
}
```

**Error Responses (400-599): Standardized format** (from Decision 4)
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "BARCODE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Código de barras no encontrado",
    "details": "Barcode '7804123456789' not in manifest 'FAL-20260206'",
    "field": "barcode",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-06T14:30:00Z",
    "request_id": "req_abc123"
  }
}
```

**Pagination Format: Cursor-based** (for large datasets)
```json
{
  "data": [ /* orders */ ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ==",
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

**Rationale:** Direct responses are simpler, errors use standardized format, cursor pagination scales better than offset.

---

#### **Data Exchange Formats**

**Dates: Always ISO 8601 strings**
```json
// ✅ Correct
{
  "created_at": "2026-02-06T14:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-02-06T15:45:00Z"
}

// ❌ Incorrect
{
  "created_at": 1675694400,                // No timestamps
  "updated_at": "2026-02-06"               // No partial dates (missing time)
}
```

**Booleans: Always `true`/`false`**
```json
// ✅ Correct
{
  "is_verified": true,
  "has_discrepancies": false
}

// ❌ Incorrect
{
  "is_verified": 1,                        // Don't use 1/0
  "has_discrepancies": "false"             // Don't use strings
}
```

**Null Handling: Use `null`, not `undefined`**
```json
// ✅ Correct
{
  "signature_url": null,
  "notes": null
}

// ❌ Incorrect
{
  "signature_url": undefined,              // undefined doesn't exist in JSON
  // "notes": missing                      // Include null fields explicitly
}
```

**Arrays: Always arrays, even for single item**
```json
// ✅ Correct
{
  "scans": ["barcode1"]
}

// ❌ Incorrect
{
  "scans": "barcode1"                      // Don't change type based on count
}
```

**JSON Field Naming: `snake_case`** (matches database)
```json
// ✅ Correct
{
  "order_id": "123",
  "created_at": "2026-02-06T14:30:00Z",
  "operator_id": "op-456",
  "customer_name": "María González"
}

// ❌ Incorrect
{
  "orderId": "123",                        // Don't use camelCase
  "CreatedAt": "...",                      // Don't use PascalCase
}
```

**Rationale:** snake_case matches PostgreSQL, ISO dates are unambiguous timezone-aware, consistent array handling prevents bugs.

---

### Communication Patterns

#### **Event Naming (Supabase Realtime, Custom Events)**

**Format: `resource.action` (lowercase, dot-separated)**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
"order.created"
"order.updated"
"order.deleted"
"manifest.signed"
"scan.completed"
"sync.started"
"sync.completed"

// ❌ Incorrect
"OrderCreated"                             // Don't use PascalCase
"ORDER_CREATED"                            // Don't use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
"create-order"                             // Don't use action-resource order
"onOrderCreate"                            // Don't use handler naming
```

**Event Payload Structure:**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
interface AppEvent<T = unknown> {
  type: string                             // Event name (e.g., "order.created")
  timestamp: string                        // ISO 8601
  operator_id: string                      // Tenant context
  user_id?: string                         // User who triggered (if applicable)
  data: T                                  // Event-specific data
}

// Example
{
  type: "order.created",
  timestamp: "2026-02-06T14:30:00Z",
  operator_id: "op-123",
  user_id: "user-456",
  data: {
    order_id: "order-789",
    order_number: "FAL-001",
    status: "pending"
  }
}
```

**Supabase Realtime Subscriptions:**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
supabase
  .channel('orders')
  .on('postgres_changes',
    { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'orders' },
    (payload) => {
      // Handle order.created
    }
  )
  .subscribe()
```

**Rationale:** Lowercase dot notation is clear, resource.action reads naturally, consistent with event sourcing patterns.

---

#### **Zustand Store Patterns**

**Store Naming: `use` + `ResourceName` + `Store`**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
useScanStore
useAuthStore
useDashboardStore
useSyncStore

// ❌ Incorrect
scanStore                                  // Missing 'use' prefix (not a hook)
useScans                                   // Missing 'Store' suffix
ScanStore                                  // Don't use PascalCase
```

**Store Structure: State + Actions**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
interface ScanStore {
  // State
  scans: Scan[]
  isSyncing: boolean
  lastSyncTime: string | null

  // Actions (verbs)
  addScan: (barcode: string) => void
  removeScan: (id: string) => void
  clearScans: () => void
  markSynced: (id: string) => void
  setSyncing: (syncing: boolean) => void
}

const useScanStore = create<ScanStore>((set) => ({
  // Initial state
  scans: [],
  isSyncing: false,
  lastSyncTime: null,

  // Actions
  addScan: (barcode) => set((state) => ({
    scans: [...state.scans, { id: generateId(), barcode, synced: false }]
  })),

  removeScan: (id) => set((state) => ({
    scans: state.scans.filter(s => s.id !== id)
  })),

  clearScans: () => set({ scans: [] }),

  markSynced: (id) => set((state) => ({
    scans: state.scans.map(s => s.id === id ? { ...s, synced: true } : s)
  })),

  setSyncing: (isSyncing) => set({ isSyncing })
}))
```

**Immutable Updates: ALWAYS**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct (immutable)
addScan: (barcode) => set((state) => ({
  scans: [...state.scans, newScan]         // Create new array
}))

removeScan: (id) => set((state) => ({
  scans: state.scans.filter(s => s.id !== id)  // Returns new array
}))

// ❌ Incorrect (mutation)
addScan: (barcode) => set((state) => {
  state.scans.push(newScan)                // Mutates existing array
  return state
})
```

**Persistence (for offline data):**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useScanStore = create(
  persist<ScanStore>(
    (set) => ({
      scans: [],
      addScan: (barcode) => set((state) => ({ ... }))
    }),
    {
      name: 'scan-queue-storage',          // localStorage key
      partialize: (state) => ({             // Only persist necessary state
        scans: state.scans
      })
    }
  )
)
```

**Rationale:** Zustand is simple, immutability prevents bugs, persist middleware enables offline capability.

---

### Process Patterns

#### **Error Handling Patterns**

**API Layer: Try-Catch with Structured Logging**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
import { logger } from '@/lib/utils/logger'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const requestId = generateRequestId()

  try {
    const { user, operator_id } = await validateAuth(request)
    const body = await request.json()

    // Validation
    const validation = validateOrderInput(body)
    if (!validation.success) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        {
          error: {
            code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
            message: 'Datos inválidos',
            details: validation.error,
            field: validation.field,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
            request_id: requestId
          }
        },
        { status: 400 }
      )
    }

    // Business logic
    const order = await createOrder(body, operator_id)

    return NextResponse.json(order, { status: 201 })

  } catch (error) {
    // Structured logging
    logger.error({
      error_code: 'ORDER_CREATE_FAILED',
      request_id: requestId,
      operator_id: request.user?.operator_id,
      user_id: request.user?.id,
      error_message: error.message,
      stack_trace: error.stack,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })

    // User-facing error response
    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        error: {
          code: 'ORDER_CREATE_FAILED',
          message: 'No se pudo crear la orden',
          details: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? error.message : undefined,
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
          request_id: requestId
        }
      },
      { status: 500 }
    )
  }
}
```

**React Error Boundaries:**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct: components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx
import React from 'react'

interface Props {
  children: React.ReactNode
  fallback?: React.ReactNode
}

interface State {
  hasError: boolean
  error?: Error
}

export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  constructor(props: Props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false }
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {
    return { hasError: true, error }
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: React.ErrorInfo) {
    // Log to Sentry
    logger.error({
      error_code: 'REACT_ERROR_BOUNDARY',
      error_message: error.message,
      component_stack: errorInfo.componentStack,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return this.props.fallback || (
        <div>
          <h2>Algo salió mal</h2>
          <button onClick={() => window.location.reload()}>
            Recargar aplicación
          </button>
        </div>
      )
    }

    return this.props.children
  }
}

// Usage in app/layout.tsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Dashboard />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

**Form Validation: Inline + Toast**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const handleSubmit = async (data) => {
  try {
    await apiClient.post('/api/orders', data)
    toast.success('Orden creada exitosamente')
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.response?.status === 400) {
      // Inline validation error
      setFieldError(error.response.data.error.field, error.response.data.error.message)
    } else {
      // General error toast
      toast.error(error.response?.data?.error?.message || 'Error al crear orden')
    }
  }
}
```

**Rationale:** Structured logging enables debugging, error boundaries prevent app crashes, inline validation provides immediate feedback.

---

#### **Loading State Patterns**

**Naming: `isLoading` prefix for booleans**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false)
const [isSyncing, setIsSyncing] = useState(false)

// ❌ Incorrect
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)        // Not boolean-obvious
const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false)  // Ambiguous type
```

**TanStack Query: Use provided states**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const { data, isLoading, isError, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['orders'],
  queryFn: fetchOrders
})

if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />
if (isError) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />
return <OrdersList orders={data} />

// ❌ Incorrect
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)        // Don't duplicate TanStack Query state
```

**Global vs Local Loading:**
```typescript
// ✅ Global: Full-page loading (initial page load)
app/dashboard/loading.tsx                            // Next.js loading UI

// ✅ Local: Component-level loading (button, card)
<Button disabled={isSubmitting}>
  {isSubmitting ? <Spinner /> : 'Guardar'}
</Button>
```

**Optimistic Updates (show immediate feedback):**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const { mutate } = useMutation({
  mutationFn: createOrder,
  onMutate: async (newOrder) => {
    // Optimistically add to UI
    queryClient.setQueryData(['orders'], (old) => [...old, newOrder])
  },
  onError: (error, newOrder, context) => {
    // Rollback on error
    queryClient.setQueryData(['orders'], context.previousOrders)
    toast.error('Error al crear orden')
  }
})
```

**Rationale:** Consistent loading state naming, leverage TanStack Query built-ins, optimistic updates improve perceived performance.

---

### Enforcement Guidelines

#### **All AI Agents MUST Follow These Rules**

**1. Naming Conventions:**
- ✅ Database: `snake_case` for tables/columns
- ✅ API JSON: `snake_case` for field names
- ✅ TypeScript: `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for components/types
- ✅ Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- ✅ Files: `PascalCase.tsx` for components, `camelCase.ts` for utilities

**2. API Standards:**
- ✅ REST endpoints: `/api/resource` (plural, lowercase)
- ✅ Success: Return data directly (no `{data: ...}` wrapper)
- ✅ Errors: Use standardized format with `code`, `message`, `details`, `request_id`
- ✅ Dates: ISO 8601 strings only (`"2026-02-06T14:30:00Z"`)
- ✅ HTTP status codes: Standard codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 500, 503)

**3. State Management:**
- ✅ Zustand: Immutable updates always (use spread operators, `.map()`, `.filter()`)
- ✅ TanStack Query: Use for all API data fetching
- ✅ Loading states: `isLoading` prefix
- ✅ Events: `resource.action` format (lowercase, dot-separated)

**4. File Organization:**
- ✅ Components by feature: `components/dashboard/`, `components/pickup/`
- ✅ API routes: Match REST structure `/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`
- ✅ Types centralized: All in `types/` directory
- ✅ Tests mirror structure: `__tests__/components/dashboard/`

**5. Error Handling:**
- ✅ Try-catch in API routes with structured logging
- ✅ Error boundaries in React for component crashes
- ✅ Include `request_id` in all error responses
- ✅ Toast notifications for transient errors, inline validation for forms

---

#### **Pattern Enforcement**

**Linting (ESLint + TypeScript):**
```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/naming-convention": [
      "error",
      {
        "selector": "variable",
        "format": ["camelCase", "UPPER_CASE"]
      },
      {
        "selector": "function",
        "format": ["camelCase"]
      },
      {
        "selector": "typeLike",
        "format": ["PascalCase"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Naming follows conventions (snake_case DB, camelCase TS, PascalCase components)
- [ ] API responses use standardized format
- [ ] Dates are ISO 8601 strings
- [ ] Zustand updates are immutable
- [ ] Error handling includes request_id
- [ ] Tests exist for new components/functions
- [ ] TypeScript types are defined (no `any`)

**Documentation:**
- Patterns violations should be documented in GitHub PR comments
- Update this architecture document if patterns evolve
- Use OpenAPI schema validation for API contracts

---

### Pattern Examples

#### **Good Examples**

**✅ Creating a new API endpoint:**
```typescript
// app/api/scans/route.ts

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { createClient } from '@/lib/db/supabase'
import { validateAuth } from '@/lib/api/auth'
import { logger } from '@/lib/utils/logger'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const requestId = generateRequestId()

  try {
    const { user, operator_id } = await validateAuth(request)
    const { barcode, manifest_id } = await request.json()

    const supabase = createClient()

    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('barcode_scans')                           // snake_case table
      .insert({
        operator_id,                                    // snake_case column
        manifest_id,
        barcode,
        scanned_by: user.id,
        scanned_at: new Date().toISOString()            // ISO 8601
      })
      .select()
      .single()

    if (error) throw error

    return NextResponse.json(data, { status: 201 })    // Direct response

  } catch (error) {
    logger.error({
      error_code: 'SCAN_CREATE_FAILED',
      request_id: requestId,
      operator_id: user?.operator_id,
      error: error.message
    })

    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        error: {
          code: 'SCAN_CREATE_FAILED',
          message: 'No se pudo registrar el escaneo',
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
          request_id: requestId
        }
      },
      { status: 500 }
    )
  }
}
```

**✅ Creating a Zustand store:**
```typescript
// lib/stores/scanStore.ts

import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface Scan {
  id: string
  barcode: string
  timestamp: string                        // ISO 8601
  synced: boolean
}

interface ScanStore {
  scans: Scan[]
  isSyncing: boolean

  addScan: (barcode: string) => void
  removeScan: (id: string) => void
  clearScans: () => void
  markSynced: (id: string) => void
}

export const useScanStore = create<ScanStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      scans: [],
      isSyncing: false,

      addScan: (barcode) => set((state) => ({
        scans: [
          ...state.scans,                              // Immutable
          {
            id: crypto.randomUUID(),
            barcode,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),       // ISO 8601
            synced: false
          }
        ]
      })),

      removeScan: (id) => set((state) => ({
        scans: state.scans.filter(s => s.id !== id)    // Immutable
      })),

      clearScans: () => set({ scans: [] }),

      markSynced: (id) => set((state) => ({
        scans: state.scans.map(s =>                    // Immutable
          s.id === id ? { ...s, synced: true } : s
        )
      }))
    }),
    {
      name: 'scan-queue-storage'                       // localStorage key
    }
  )
)
```

#### **Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)**

**❌ Inconsistent naming:**
```typescript
// ❌ Bad
CREATE TABLE Orders (...)                              // Don't use PascalCase
const User_ID = "123"                                  // Don't use snake_case in TS
function GetUserData() {}                              // Don't use PascalCase for functions
```

**❌ Mutating state:**
```typescript
// ❌ Bad
addScan: (barcode) => set((state) => {
  state.scans.push({ barcode })                        // Mutation!
  return state
})
```

**❌ Wrapped API responses:**
```typescript
// ❌ Bad
return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,                                       // Unnecessary
  data: order                                          // Just return order directly
})
```

**❌ Inconsistent date formats:**
```typescript
// ❌ Bad
{
  "created_at": 1675694400,                            // Timestamp
  "updated_at": "2026-02-06"                           // Partial date
}

// ✅ Good
{
  "created_at": "2026-02-06T14:30:00Z",                // ISO 8601
  "updated_at": "2026-02-06T15:45:00Z"                 // ISO 8601
}
```

**❌ Missing error details:**
```typescript
// ❌ Bad
return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed" }, { status: 500 })

// ✅ Good
return NextResponse.json({
  error: {
    code: 'ORDER_CREATE_FAILED',
    message: 'No se pudo crear la orden',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    request_id: requestId
  }
}, { status: 500 })
```

### Pattern Update Process

**When patterns need to change:**
1. Propose change in GitHub issue/PR
2. Discuss with team (or user Gerhard)
3. Update this architecture document
4. Update `.eslintrc.json` rules if applicable
5. Run codemod/find-replace to update existing code
6. Communicate change to all AI agents (via updated architecture doc)

### Architectural Boundaries

#### **API Boundaries**

**External API Endpoints (Public-Facing):**
```
Authentication:
  POST   /api/auth/login
  POST   /api/auth/logout
  POST   /api/auth/refresh

Webhooks (Retailers → Aureon):
  POST   /api/integrations/webhooks/:retailerId
```

**Internal API Endpoints (Authenticated, Tenant-Scoped):**
```
All endpoints require:
  - Valid JWT token (Authorization: Bearer <token>)
  - Automatic tenant filtering via middleware (operator_id)
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)

Example:
  GET /api/orders → Returns only orders for authenticated operator
  POST /api/scans → Automatically tagged with operator_id
```

**API Layer Responsibilities:**
- JWT validation (Supabase Auth)
- Rate limiting (1000 req/min per operator)
- Request logging with request_id
- Error handling (standardized format)
- Database queries (via Supabase client)
- Cache management (Redis on Railway)

---

#### **Component Boundaries**

**Frontend Component Communication:**

```
User Action (Button Click)
    ↓
Component Event Handler
    ↓
Zustand Store (Local State) OR TanStack Query (Server State)
    ↓
    ├─ Local: Update Zustand state → Re-render components
    └─ Server: API call → TanStack Query caches → Re-render components
    ↓
Other Components Subscribe to State
    ↓
UI Updates
```

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
App Layout (layout.tsx)
    ├─ Header (shared across all pages)
    ├─ Sidebar (navigation, role-based)
    └─ Page Content (route-specific)
        ├─ Feature Components (dashboard/, pickup/, etc.)
        │   └─ UI Components (buttons, cards, inputs)
        └─ Shared Components (loading, errors, pagination)
```

**State Boundaries:**
- **Zustand stores**: Isolated per domain (scanStore, authStore, syncStore)
- **TanStack Query**: Automatic caching per query key
- **Supabase Realtime**: Live updates push to TanStack Query cache
- **Component props**: One-way data flow (parent → child)

---

#### **Service Boundaries**

**Service Layer Organization:**

```
Frontend (Vercel - Next.js API Routes)
    ↓
    ↔  Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime + Storage)  ↔  VPS (n8n 2.x + Worker + Playwright)
    ↓                                                              ↓
External Services                                          External Sources
    ├─ Retailer APIs (Falabella, Shopee, etc.)             ├─ IMAP email (manifest attachments)
    ├─ Routing Tools (SimpliRoute, Beetrack, Driv.in)      ├─ Retailer web portals (Playwright)
    └─ AI Services (Claude API for support agent)          └─ Groq API (Llama 4 Scout — Story 2.6)

Contract Layer: Supabase is the sole communication bridge between Vercel and VPS.
No direct Vercel ↔ VPS communication.
No Redis. Job queue = Supabase jobs table (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED).
```

**Service Communication Patterns:**

1. **Frontend ↔ API:** HTTP/REST (fetch/Axios)
2. **API ↔ Database:** Supabase Client (PostgreSQL driver)
3. **API ↔ Cache:** Redis commands (SET/GET/DEL)
4. **API ↔ n8n:** HTTP webhooks + n8n API calls
5. **Frontend ↔ Realtime:** Supabase WebSocket subscriptions
6. **n8n ↔ Retailers:** HTTP (API calls + email IMAP)

---

#### **Data Boundaries**

**Database Schema Boundaries:**

```
Multi-Tenant Data (operator_id required on ALL tables):
  - operators
  - users
  - orders
  - manifests
  - barcode_scans
  - inventory_items
  - sectorization_rules
  - capacity_alerts

Shared Configuration (no operator_id):
  - retailers (global retailer definitions)
  - routing_tools (global routing tool definitions)

Audit Data (immutable, operator_id scoped):
  - audit_logs (7-year retention)
  - integration_logs

System Data (platform-wide):
  - platform_health_metrics
  - subscription_tiers
```

**Data Access Patterns:**

```
// Supabase RLS automatically filters by operator_id
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('*')
  // No WHERE operator_id needed - RLS adds automatically

// RLS Policy Example:
CREATE POLICY "tenant_isolation" ON orders
  FOR ALL
  USING (operator_id = auth.operator_id());
```

**Caching Boundaries:**
- **Redis (Railway)**: API response caching (5-60 min TTL)
- **TanStack Query (Frontend)**: Client-side caching (30s-5min stale time)
- **Supabase**: Database query caching (automatic)
- **IndexedDB (PWA)**: Offline scan queue (persists until synced)

---

### Integration Points

#### **Internal Communication**

**Frontend → API:**
```typescript
// lib/api/client.ts - Centralized API client
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  timeout: 30000,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})

// Automatic auth header injection
apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = getAuthToken()
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`
  }
  return config
})

// Automatic error handling
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Token expired, refresh or logout
    }
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
)
```

**API → Database:**
```typescript
// lib/db/supabase.ts - Supabase client
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

export const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY!  // Server-side only
)

// Example query with RLS
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('*')
  .eq('status', 'pending')
  // operator_id filter added automatically by RLS
```

**Frontend ↔ Real-time:**
```typescript
// lib/hooks/useRealtime.ts - Supabase Realtime wrapper
export function useOrderUpdates(operatorId: string) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const channel = supabase
      .channel('orders')
      .on('postgres_changes',
        { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'orders' },
        (payload) => {
          // Update TanStack Query cache
          queryClient.setQueryData(['orders'], (old) => [...old, payload.new])
        }
      )
      .subscribe()

    return () => { supabase.removeChannel(channel) }
  }, [operatorId])
}
```

---

#### **External Integrations**

**n8n Integration Workflows:**

```
1. Email Manifest Import:
   IMAP (Gmail/Outlook)
      ↓
   n8n: Email Trigger (every 5 min)
      ↓
   n8n: Filter (subject contains "Manifiesto")
      ↓
   n8n: Download CSV Attachment
      ↓
   n8n: CSV Parser
      ↓
   n8n: Data Transform (Retailer schema → Aureon schema)
      ↓
   HTTP POST → Railway API /api/manifests/import
      ↓
   Aureon DB (orders created)

2. Retailer API Sync:
   n8n: Cron Trigger (every 15 min)
      ↓
   n8n: HTTP Request → Falabella API /orders
      ↓
   n8n: Transform Data
      ↓
   HTTP POST → Railway API /api/manifests/import
      ↓
   Aureon DB

3. Webhook Receiver (Routing Tools):
   SimpliRoute Webhook → /api/integrations/webhooks
      ↓
   Railway API receives delivery status update
      ↓
   n8n: Transform status (SimpliRoute format → Retailer format)
      ↓
   HTTP POST → Falabella Webhook /status
      ↓
   Retailer receives update
```

**Retailer API Adapters:**
```typescript
// lib/integrations/retailers/falabella.ts
export const falabellaAdapter = {
  async fetchOrders(date: string) {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.falabella.com/orders', {
      headers: { 'X-API-Key': process.env.FALABELLA_API_KEY },
      params: { date }
    })

    // Transform Falabella format → Aureon format
    return response.data.orders.map(order => ({
      order_number: order.numero_pedido,
      customer_name: order.nombre_cliente,
      delivery_address: order.direccion,
      retailer_name: 'Falabella',
      raw_data: order  // Store original
    }))
  },

  async sendStatusUpdate(orderId: string, status: string) {
    // Transform Aureon status → Falabella format
    const falabellaStatus = mapStatus(status)

    await axios.post('https://api.falabella.com/webhooks/status', {
      numero_pedido: orderId,
      estado: falabellaStatus,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    }, {
      headers: { 'X-API-Key': process.env.FALABELLA_API_KEY }
    })
  }
}
```

---

#### **Data Flow**

**Complete Flow: Manifest Import → Pickup → Delivery → Status Update**

```
1. Manifest Import (Retailer → Aureon):
   Falabella Email (CSV)
      ↓
   n8n IMAP → Parse CSV
      ↓
   POST /api/manifests/import
      ↓
   Supabase: Insert into orders table (status: 'pending')
      ↓
   Realtime: Push to frontend (TanStack Query invalidates cache)
      ↓
   Dashboard updates live

2. Pickup Verification (Crew → Mobile PWA):
   Crew opens /pickup/:manifestId
      ↓
   TanStack Query: GET /api/manifests/:id
      ↓
   Display orders (347 orders for Falabella)
      ↓
   Crew scans barcode (offline)
      ↓
   Zustand: Add to offline queue (IndexedDB)
      ↓
   Optimistic UI update (progress bar 1/347 → 2/347)
      ↓
   Background Sync (when online)
      ↓
   POST /api/scans (batch upload)
      ↓
   Supabase: Insert into barcode_scans
      ↓
   Zustand: Mark scans as synced

3. Digital Signature & Receipt:
   Crew completes scanning (347/347)
      ↓
   Navigate to /pickup/:manifestId/sign
      ↓
   Capture signature (canvas element)
      ↓
   POST /api/manifests/:id/sign { signature_data_url }
      ↓
   Supabase Storage: Upload signature image
      ↓
   Supabase: Update manifest (signed: true)
      ↓
   Generate PDF receipt (client-side jsPDF)
      ↓
   Download PDF or share via WhatsApp

4. Status Updates (Aureon → Retailer):
   Order delivered
      ↓
   SimpliRoute webhook → POST /api/integrations/webhooks
      ↓
   Railway API: Update order status (delivered)
      ↓
   BullMQ Job: Notify retailer
      ↓
   n8n: Transform status
      ↓
   POST to Falabella webhook
      ↓
   Falabella receives update within 5 min
```

### File Organization Patterns

#### **Configuration Files (Root Level)**

```
package.json              # Dependencies, scripts
next.config.js            # Next.js config (PWA, environment variables)
tailwind.config.ts        # Tailwind CSS customization
tsconfig.json             # TypeScript compiler options
.env.local                # Local environment variables (not committed)
.env.example              # Example environment variables (committed)
.eslintrc.json            # ESLint rules (naming conventions)
jest.config.js            # Jest testing config
playwright.config.ts      # Playwright E2E config
```

#### **Source Organization (src/)**

**By Feature (Not By Type):**
```
✅ Good:
  components/dashboard/MetricsCard.tsx
  components/dashboard/PerformanceChart.tsx
  components/pickup/ScanButton.tsx

❌ Bad:
  components/cards/MetricsCard.tsx
  components/cards/ScanCard.tsx
  components/charts/PerformanceChart.tsx
```

**Utilities Centralized:**
```
lib/utils/formatDate.ts         # Date formatting utilities
lib/utils/validation.ts         # Form validation
lib/api/client.ts               # API client wrapper
lib/stores/scanStore.ts         # Zustand store
```

#### **Test Organization (__tests__/)**

**Mirrors Source Structure:**
```
src/components/dashboard/MetricsCard.tsx
  → __tests__/components/dashboard/MetricsCard.test.tsx

src/lib/utils/formatDate.ts
  → __tests__/lib/utils/formatDate.test.ts

src/app/api/orders/route.ts
  → __tests__/api/orders.test.ts
```

#### **Asset Organization (public/)**

```
public/
  icons/                  # PWA icons, favicon
  images/                 # Static images (logo, placeholders)
  manifest.json           # PWA manifest
```

---

### Development Workflow Integration

#### **Development Server Structure**

```bash
# Start all services locally
npm run dev                # Next.js dev server (http://localhost:3000)
supabase start             # Local Supabase (PostgreSQL on port 54322)
# n8n runs separately on Railway (or local Docker)

# Environment variables loaded from .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-local-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

#### **Build Process Structure**

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build              # Next.js production build
  ↓
.next/                     # Build output
  ├── static/              # Static assets (hashed filenames)
  ├── server/              # Server-side code
  └── standalone/          # Standalone deployment bundle

# Type checking
npm run type-check         # TypeScript compilation check

# Testing
npm run test               # Jest unit tests
npm run test:e2e           # Playwright E2E tests
```

#### **Deployment Structure**

```
Vercel Deployment (Frontend):
  - Auto-deploy on git push to main
  - Preview deployments for PRs
  - Environment variables from Vercel dashboard
  - Serves .next/static/ from global CDN

Railway Deployment (Backend + n8n):
  - Auto-deploy on git push to main
  - Separate services:
    - aureon-api (Next.js API routes)
    - n8n (integration workflows)
    - redis (caching + BullMQ)
  - Environment variables from Railway dashboard

Supabase (Database):
  - Migrations applied via supabase db push
  - Production database separate from local
```
